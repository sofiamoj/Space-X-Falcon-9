# Applied Data Science Capstone
IBM

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this module, you will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.

## IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This repository showcases the completion of the IBM Data Science Capstone Project, where you'll explore the power of Python for data analysis.

**Project Goals:**

* **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** Master data wrangling techniques using Pandas data frames for efficient data organization and transformation.
* **JSON to Pandas Conversion:** Seamlessly convert data from JSON files into Pandas data frames for further analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook Creation and Sharing:** Utilize Jupyter Notebook as your interactive development environment and share your findings through GitHub.
* **Real-World Business Problem Formulation:** Apply data science methodologies to define a tangible business challenge and translate it into a data-driven solution.
* **Data Analysis and Insights:** Load a dataset, clean and prepare it for analysis, and leverage data analysis tools to uncover valuable insights.
* **Data Visualization:** Visualize your findings effectively using industry-standard data visualization libraries to communicate insights clearly.
* **Machine Learning Exploration (Optional):** (**Note:** Accuracy detection is typically referred to as "evaluation" in machine learning). If applicable, incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict future trends or occurrences, followed by an evaluation of their accuracy. 

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python (version 3.x recommended) and Jupyter Notebook installed. Instructions can be found at [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone this repository locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git
   ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-repository-name>` with the actual name of your repository.

**Project Structure:**

* **`data`**: This folder will contain any datasets used in the project.
* **`notebooks`**: This folder will house the Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implemented code.
* **`reports`**: If you create reports for documentation purposes, place them here (optional).

**Instructions:**

1. **Navigate to the Repository:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
2. **Set Up Environment (Optional):** If the project involves specific dependencies, create a virtual environment and install them using `pip`. Refer to virtual environment documentation for details.

**Jupyter Notebooks:**

The `notebooks` folder will contain Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the data science workflow specific to the chosen business problem. Open these notebooks in Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and execution of code.

**Disclaimer:**

The purpose of this Capstone project is to provide hands-on experience with core data science concepts in Python. Machine learning algorithms can be complex, and results may vary depending on the chosen datasets and techniques.

**Contribution:**

Feel free to document your project journey and insights within the notebooks. Consider sharing your learnings with the community by forking this repository and contributing your work! Refer to GitHub's contribution guidelines for instructions.
